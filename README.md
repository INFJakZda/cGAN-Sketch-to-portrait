# cGAN-Sketch-to-portrait
Image-to-image translation using Conditional Adversarial Networks developed with the aim of translation sketch to portrait. Pix2pix architecture was used. 

Training dataset was prepared using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/laurentmih/aisegmentcom-matting-human-datasets">AISegment.com - Matting Human Datasets</a>. Additionally images were cropped and resized to 256x256 pixel size.   There are only portraits images, so in order to obtain sketch images, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mengtial/proj/sketch/">Photo-Sketching Image</a> project was used.
